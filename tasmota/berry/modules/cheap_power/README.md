The default number of active price slots per day is 1. It can be set in the
web user interface.

### Web User Interface

The user interface in the main menu consists of the following buttons:
* ‚èÆ moves the first time slot earlier (or wraps from the beginning to the end)
* ‚è≠ moves the first time slot later (or wraps from the end to the beginning)
* ‚èØ pauses (switches off) or chooses the optimal slots
* üîÑ requests the prices to be downloaded and the optimal slots to be chosen
* ‚ûñ decreases the number of slots (minimum: 1)
* ‚ûï increases the number of slots (maximum: currently available price slots)

The status output above the buttons may indicate that the output
is paused until further command or price update:
```
(0‚â§1)0.299‚Ä•2.38 ¬¢/kWh	‚≠ò
```
Or it may indicate the price and duration until the next active slot:
```
(1‚â§1)0.299‚Ä•2.38 ¬¢/kWh (0.299)	‚≠ô 5:05
```
Or it may indicate the price of the currently active time slot:
```
(1‚â§1)0.299‚Ä•2.38 ¬¢/kWh (0.299)	‚≠ô
```
The first number indicates the number of remaining scheduled time slots,
and the second number indicates the maximum number of time slots per day
(default 1).

The two quantities around the ‚Ä• are the minimum and maximum known prices
from the current time onwards.

The scheduled slots are also indicated by red bars in the line graph
of the available current and future prices.
