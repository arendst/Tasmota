# RELEASE NOTES

## Migration Information

**This version removes support for direct migration from versions before v8.1.0 (Doris)**

See [migration path](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Upgrading#migration-path) for instructions how to migrate to a major version.

**Do not upgrade from minimal to minimal version. It will most likely fail at some point and will require flashing via serial.** If you do have to use minimal versions, always OTA to a full version of the same release before applying next minimal version.

Pay attention to the following version breaks due to dynamic settings updates:

1. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 3.9.x**
2. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 4.x**
3. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 5.14** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release_5.14.0/sonoff.bin) - NOTICE underscore as a dash is not supported in older versions
4. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 6.7.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release_6.7.1/sonoff.bin) - NOTICE underscore as a dash is not supported in older versions
5. Migrate to **Tasmota 7.2.0** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-7.2.0/tasmota.bin)

--- Major change in parameter storage layout ---

6. Migrate to **Tasmota 8.5.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-8.5.1/tasmota.bin)

--- Major change in internal GPIO function representation ---

7. Migrate to **Tasmota 9.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-9.1.0/tasmota.bin.gz)
8. Upgrade to **latest release** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin.gz)

While fallback or downgrading is common practice it was never supported due to Settings additions or changes in newer releases. Starting with release **v9.1.0 Imogen** the internal GPIO function representation has changed in such a way that fallback is only possible to the latest GPIO configuration before installing **v9.1.0**.

## Supported Core versions

This release will be supported from ESP8266/Arduino library Core version **2.7.8** due to reported security and stability issues on previous Core version. This will also support gzipped binaries.

This release will be supported from ESP32/Arduino library Core version **v3.1.1.250203**.

Support of ESP8266 Core versions before 2.7.8 and ESP32 Core versions before v3.1.1.250203 have been removed.

## Support of TLS

In addition to TLS using fingerprints now also user supplied CA certs, AWS IoT and Azure IoT is supported. Read [full documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/AWS-IoT)

## Initial configuration tools

For initial configuration this release supports Webserver based **WifiManager** or **Serial** based command interface.

## Initial installation

Easy initial installation of Tasmota can be performed using the [Tasmota WebInstaller](https://tasmota.github.io/install/).
