# SPL06-007
Ardino SPL06-007 Library

This is a work in progress to create a working Arduino library for the SPL06-007 pressure sensor. I am able to get the coefficents, pressure, and temperature readings from the sensor. Need to convert to a standard Arduino library format. Code was developed and tested on an ESP32 microcontroller.
