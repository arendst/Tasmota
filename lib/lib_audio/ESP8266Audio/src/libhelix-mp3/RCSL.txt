2.4 Subcontracting.

You may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Licensees
having at least a Research Use license, for the sole purpose of
furnishing development services to You in connection with Your rights
granted in this License. All such Licensees must execute appropriate
documents with respect to such work consistent with the terms of this
License, and acknowledging their work-made-for-hire status or assigning
exclusive right to the work product and associated Intellectual Property
Rights to You.

*3. Requirements and Responsibilities*.

3.1 Research Use License.

As a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a)
above, You agree to comply with the following:

(a) Your Contribution to the Community. All Error Corrections and Shared
Modifications which You create or contribute to are automatically
subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above. You are
encouraged to license all of Your other Modifications under Section 2.2
as Shared Modifications, but are not required to do so. You agree to
notify Original Contributor of any errors in the Specification.

(b) Source Code Availability. You agree to provide all Your Error
Corrections to Original Contributor as soon as reasonably practicable
and, in any event, prior to Internal Deployment Use or Commercial Use,
if applicable. Original Contributor may, at its discretion, post Source
Code for Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on the
Community Webserver. You may also post Error Corrections and Shared
Modifications on a web-server of Your choice; provided, that You must
take reasonable precautions to ensure that only Licensees have access to
such Error Corrections and Shared Modifications. Such precautions shall
include, without limitation, a password protection scheme limited to
Licensees and a click-on, download certification of Licensee status
required of those attempting to download from the server. An example of
an acceptable certification is attached as Attachment A-2.

(c) Notices. All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications You create
or contribute to must include a file documenting the additions and
changes You made and the date of such additions and changes. You must
also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header.
If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then You must include the notice in a location
(such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most
likely to look for such a notice.

(d) Redistribution.

(i) Source. Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to
another Licensee (except for students as provided below). You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights,
requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee. You may distribute
Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work
and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.
Such students need not be Licensees, but must be given a copy of the
notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included
in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available
to such students.

(ii) Executable. You may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered
Code to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of
evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by You and under
a license of Your choice, but which limits use of such Executable
version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.

(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with
Research Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's class,
Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the
Source Code files You modify. Original Contributor grants to You a
limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes.

(iv) You expressly agree that any distribution, in whole or in part, of
Modifications developed by You shall only be done pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this License.

(e) Extensions.

(i) Covered Code. You may not include any Source Code of Community Code
in any Extensions. You may include the compiled Header Files of
Community Code in an Extension provided that Your use of the Covered
Code, including Heading Files, complies with the Commercial Use License,
the TCK and all other terms of this License.

(ii) Publication. No later than the date on which You first distribute
such Extension for Commercial Use, You must publish to the industry, on
a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright restrictions with
respect to reproduction and use, an accurate and current specification
for any Extension. In addition, You must make available an appropriate
test suite, pursuant to the same rights as the specification,
sufficiently detailed to allow any third party reasonably skilled in the
technology to produce implementations of the Extension compatible with
the specification. Such test suites must be made available as soon as
reasonably practicable but, in no event, later than ninety (90) days
after Your first Commercial Use of the Extension. You must use
reasonable efforts to promptly clarify and correct the specification and
the test suite upon written request by Original Contributor.

(iii) Open. You agree to refrain from enforcing any Intellectual
Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your
Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s)
by Original Contributor or any Licensee. This obligation does not
prevent You from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have that
would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension.

(iv) Interface Modifications and Naming. You may not modify or add to
the GUID space * * "xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59" or any other
GUID space designated by Original Contributor. You may not modify any
Interface prefix provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix
designated by Original Contributor.* *

* *

(f) You agree that any Specifications provided to You by Original
Contributor are confidential and proprietary information of Original
Contributor. You must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications
and may not disclose them to any third party without Original
Contributor's prior written consent. You may only use the Specifications
under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing
the terms of this License with respect to Covered Code. You agree not
use, copy or distribute any such Specifications except as provided in
writing by Original Contributor.

3.2 Commercial Use License.

You may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless You and
Original Contributor have executed a copy of the Commercial Use and
Trademark License attached as Attachment D.

*4. Versions of the License.*

4.1 License Versions.

time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

4.2 Effect.

Once a particular version of Covered Code has been provided under a

License. No one other than Original Contributor has the right to
promulgate License versions.

4.3 Multiple-Licensed Code.

Original Contributor may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed." "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Original
