  \class STM32WLx

  \brief Derived class for STM32WL modules.

  The radio integrated into these modules is essentially the same as the
  Semtech %SX126x external radio chips, so most of the documentation for
  those also applies here.

  One notable difference with the %SX126x radios is that this radio
  essentially combines the %SX1261 and %SX1262 by integrating both the
  low-power (LP) and high-power (HP) amplifier. See setOutputPower() and
  setRfSwitchTable() for details on how this is handled.

      This method works like Module::setRfSwitchTable(), except that you
      should use STM32WLx::OpMode_t constants for modes, which
      distinguishes between a low-power (LP) and high-power (HP) TX mode.

      For boards that do not support both modes, just omit the
      unsupported mode from the table and it will not be used (and the
      valid power range is adjusted by setOutputPower() accordingly).

      Note that the setRfSwitchTable() method should be called *before* the
      begin() method, to ensure the radio knows which modes are supported
      during initialization.
