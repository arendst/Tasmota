    // basic methods

    /*!
      \brief %LoRa modem initialization method. Must be called at least once from Arduino sketch to initialize the module.
      \param freq Carrier frequency in MHz. Allowed values range from 137.0 MHz to 960.0 MHz.
      \param bw %LoRa link bandwidth in kHz. Allowed values are 10.4, 15.6, 20.8, 31.25, 41.7, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 kHz.
      \param sf %LoRa link spreading factor. Allowed values range from 6 to 12.
      \param cr %LoRa link coding rate denominator. Allowed values range from 5 to 8.
      \param syncWord %LoRa sync word. Can be used to distinguish different networks. Note that value 0x34 is reserved for LoRaWAN networks.
      \param power Transmission output power in dBm. Allowed values range from 2 to 17 dBm.
      \param preambleLength Length of %LoRa transmission preamble in symbols. The actual preamble length is 4.25 symbols longer than the set number.
      Allowed values range from 6 to 65535.
      \param gain Gain of receiver LNA (low-noise amplifier). Can be set to any integer in range 1 to 6 where 1 is the highest gain.
      Set to 0 to enable automatic gain control (recommended).

      \brief FSK modem initialization method. Must be called at least once from Arduino sketch to initialize the module.
