## Requirements
Basically, every modern controller  (which is able to drive a display) is suitable to run LVGL. The minimal requirements are:
<ul>
<li> 16, 32 or 64 bit microcontroller or processor</li>
<li>&gt; 16 MHz clock speed is recommended</li>
<li> Flash/ROM: &gt; 64 kB for the very essential components (&gt; 180 kB is recommended)</li>
<li> RAM: 
  <ul>
    <li> Static RAM usage: ~2 kB depending on the used features and objects types</li>
    <li> Stack: &gt; 2kB (&gt; 8 kB is recommended)</li>
    <li> Dynamic data (heap): &gt; 4 KB (&gt; 32 kB is recommended if using several objects).
	    Set by <em>LV_MEM_SIZE</em> in <em>lv_conf.h</em>. </li>
    <li> Display buffer:  &gt; <em>"Horizontal resolution"</em> pixels (&gt; 10 &times; <em>"Horizontal resolution"</em> is recommended) </li>
    <li> One frame buffer in the MCU or in external display controller</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> C99 or newer compiler</li>
<li> Basic C (or C++) knowledge: 
          <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm">pointers</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm">structs</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/callbacks-in-c/">callbacks</a>.</li>

## FAQ

### Where can I ask questions?
You can ask questions in the forum: [https://forum.lvgl.io/](https://forum.lvgl.io/).

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues) for development related discussion. 
So you should use them only if your question or issue is tightly related to the development of the library. 

### Is my MCU/hardware supported?
Every MCU which is capable of driving a display via Parallel port, SPI, RGB interface or anything else and fulfills the [Requirements](#requirements) is supported by LLVGL.

This includes:
- "Common" MCUs like STM32F, STM32H, NXP Kinetis, LPC, iMX, dsPIC33, PIC32 etc. 
- Bluetooth, GSM, WiFi modules like Nordic NRF and Espressif ESP32
- Linux with frame buffer device such as /dev/fb0. This includes Single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi
- And anything else with a strong enough MCU and a periphery to drive a display

### Is my display supported?
LVGL needs just one simple driver function to copy an array of pixels into a given area of the display. 
If you can do this with your display then you can use that display with LVGL.

Some examples of the supported display types:
- TFTs with 16 or 24 bit color depth 
- Monitors with HDMI port
- Small monochrome displays
- Gray-scale displays
- even LED matrices
- or any other display where you can control the color/state of the pixels

See the [Porting](/porting/display) section to learn more.

### Nothing happens, my display driver is not called. What have I missed?
Be sure you are calling `lv_tick_inc(x)` in an interrupt and `lv_timer_handler()` in your main `while(1)`.

Learn more in the [Tick](/porting/tick) and [Task handler](/porting/task-handler) section.

### Why is the display driver called only once? Only the upper part of the display is refreshed. 
Be sure you are calling `lv_disp_flush_ready(drv)` at the end of your "*display flush callback*". 

### Why do I see only garbage on the screen?
Probably there a bug in your display driver. Try the following code without using LVGL. You should see a square with red-blue gradient.

```c
#define BUF_W 20
#define BUF_H 10

lv_color_t buf[BUF_W * BUF_H];
lv_color_t * buf_p = buf;
uint16_t x, y;
for(y = 0; y &lt; BUF_H; y++) {
    lv_color_t c = lv_color_mix(LV_COLOR_BLUE, LV_COLOR_RED, (y * 255) / BUF_H);
    for(x = 0; x &lt; BUF_W; x++){
        (*buf_p) =  c;
        buf_p++;
    }
}

lv_area_t a;
a.x1 = 10;
a.y1 = 40;
a.x2 = a.x1 + BUF_W - 1;
a.y2 = a.y1 + BUF_H - 1;
my_flush_cb(NULL, &a, buf);
```

### Why I see nonsense colors on the screen? 
Probably LVGL's color format is not compatible with your displays color format. Check `LV_COLOR_DEPTH` in *lv_conf.h*.

If you are using 16 bit colors with SPI (or other byte-oriented interface) probably you need to set `LV_COLOR_16_SWAP  1` in *lv_conf.h*. 
It swaps the upper and lower bytes of the pixels.

### How to speed up my UI?
- Turn on compiler optimization and enable cache if your MCU has
- Increase the size of the display buffer
- Use 2 display buffers and flush the buffer with DMA (or similar periphery) in the background 
- Increase the clock speed of the SPI or Parallel port if you use them to drive the display
- If your display has SPI port consider changing to a model with parallel because it has much higher throughput
- Keep the display buffer in the internal RAM (not in external SRAM) because LVGL uses it a lot and it should have a small access time
 
### How to reduce flash/ROM usage?
You can disable all the unused features (such as animations, file system, GPU etc.) and object types in *lv_conf.h*.

If you are using GCC you can add 
- `-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections` compiler flags 
- `--gc-sections` linker flag

to remove unused functions and variables from the final binary

### How to reduce the RAM usage
- Lower the size of the *Display buffer* 
- Reduce `LV_MEM_SIZE` in *lv_conf.h*. This memory used when you create objects like buttons, labels, etc.
- To work with lower `LV_MEM_SIZE` you can create the objects only when required and deleted them when they are not required anymore
 
### How to work with an operating system?

To work with an operating system where tasks can interrupt each other (preemptive) you should protect LVGL related function calls with a mutex.
See the [Operating system and interrupts](/porting/os) section to learn more.
