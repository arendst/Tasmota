# Sleep management

The MCU can go to sleep when no user input happens. In this case, the main `while(1)` should look like this:

```c
while(1) {
  /*Normal operation (no sleep) in < 1 sec inactivity*/
  if(lv_disp_get_inactive_time(NULL) < 1000) {
	  lv_task_handler();
  }
  /*Sleep after 1 sec inactivity*/
  else {
	  timer_stop();   /*Stop the timer where lv_tick_inc() is called*/
	  sleep();		    /*Sleep the MCU*/
  }
  my_delay_ms(5);
}
```

You should also add the below lines to your input device read function to signal a wake-up (press, touch or click etc.) happened:
```c
lv_tick_inc(LV_DISP_DEF_REFR_PERIOD);  /*Force task execution on wake-up*/
timer_start();                         /*Restart the timer where lv_tick_inc() is called*/
lv_task_handler();                     /*Call `lv_task_handler()` manually to process the wake-up event*/
```

In addition to `lv_disp_get_inactive_time()` you can check `lv_anim_count_running()` to see if all animations have finished.
