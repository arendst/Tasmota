# Tick interface

LVGL needs a system tick to know elapsed time for animations and other tasks.

You need to call the `lv_tick_inc(tick_period)` function periodically and provide the call period in milliseconds. For example, `lv_tick_inc(1)` when calling every millisecond.

`lv_tick_inc` should be called in a higher priority routine than `lv_task_handler()` (e.g. in an interrupt) to precisely know the elapsed milliseconds even if the execution of `lv_task_handler` takes more time.

With FreeRTOS `lv_tick_inc` can be called in `vApplicationTickHook`.

On Linux based operating system (e.g. on Raspberry Pi) `lv_tick_inc` can be called in a thread like below:
```c
void * tick_thread (void *args)
{
      while(1) {
        usleep(5*1000);   /*Sleep for 5 millisecond*/
        lv_tick_inc(5);      /*Tell LVGL that 5 milliseconds were elapsed*/
    }
}
```
