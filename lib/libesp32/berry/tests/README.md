## Test Quality Assurance

- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests cover both common usage patterns and edge cases
- **Security Focus** - Dedicated tests for vulnerability prevention and attack resistance  
- **Regression Prevention** - Tests prevent reintroduction of previously fixed bugs
- **Documentation** - Each test file includes synthetic comments explaining test purpose
- **Automated Execution** - Full test suite runs via `make test` command

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Include descriptive comments explaining test purpose
3. Cover both positive and negative test cases
4. Add security tests for any new parsing or input handling code
5. Update this README with new test descriptions

## Notes

- All tests pass successfully in the current Berry implementation
- Security tests include comprehensive JSON parsing vulnerability prevention
- Test files use `.be` extension (Berry script files)
- Tests are designed to run independently and can be executed individually
