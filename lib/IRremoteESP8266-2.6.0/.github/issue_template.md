### Version/revison of the library used
_Typically located in the `library.json` & `src/IRremoteESP8266.h` files in the root directory of the library.
e.g. v2.0.0, or 'master' as at 1st of June, 2017. etc._

### Expected behavior
_What steps did you do and what should it have done?_

e.g.
1. Initialise the IRsend class.
2. IRsend.sendFoobar(0xdeadbeef);
3. Foobar branded BBQ turns on and cooks me some ribs.

### Actual behavior
_What steps did you do, and what did or didn't actually happen?_

e.g.
1. Initialise the IRsend class.
2. IRsend.sendFoobar(0xdeadbeef);
3. Foobar BBQ went into Cow(er)-saving mode and fried me a couple of eggs instead.

#### Output of raw data from IRrecvDumpV2.ino (if applicable)
_Include some raw dumps of what the device saw._

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
_What can we do to (pref. reliably) repeat what is happening?_

#### Example code used
_Include all relevant code snippets or links to the actual code files. Tip: [How to quote your code so it is still readable](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)._

#### Circuit diagram and hardware used (if applicable)
_Link to an image of the circuit diagram used. Part number of the IR receiver module etc._
