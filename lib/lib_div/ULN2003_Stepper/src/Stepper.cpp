 *
 * Drives a unipolar, bipolar, or five phase stepper motor.
 *
 * When wiring multiple stepper motors to a microcontroller, you quickly run
 * out of output pins, with each motor requiring 4 connections.
 *
 * By making use of the fact that at any time two of the four motor coils are
 * the inverse of the other two, the number of control connections can be
 * reduced from 4 to 2 for the unipolar and bipolar motors.
 *
 * A slightly modified circuit around a Darlington transistor array or an
 * L293 H-bridge connects to only 2 microcontroler pins, inverts the signals
 * received, and delivers the 4 (2 plus 2 inverted ones) output signals
 * required for driving a stepper motor. Similarly the Arduino motor shields
 * 2 direction pins may be used.
 *
 * The sequence of control signals for 4 control wires is as follows:
 *
 * Step C0 C1 C2 C3
 *    1  1  0  1  0
 *    2  0  1  1  0
 *    3  0  1  0  1
 *    4  1  0  0  1
 *
 * The sequence of controls signals for 2 control wires is as follows
 * (columns C1 and C2 from above):
 *
 * Step C0 C1
 *    1  0  1
 *    2  1  1
 *    3  1  0
 *    4  0  0
 *
 * The circuits can be found at
