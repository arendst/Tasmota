Secure your project with biometrics - this all-in-one optical fingerprint sensor will make adding fingerprint detection and verification super simple. These modules are typically used in safes - there's a high powered DSP chip that does the image rendering, calculation, feature-finding and searching. Connect to any microcontroller or system with TTL serial, and send packets of data to take photos, detect prints, hash and search. You can also enroll new fingers directly - up to 162 finger prints can be stored in the onboard FLASH memory. There's a red LED in the lens that lights up during a photo so you know its working.

The Rugged Panel Mount Fingerprint Sensor with Bi-Color LED Ring even has an LED ring built around the detection pad, which can be set to red, blue or purple (as well as some fading/blinking effects) for a great user experience.


Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit Fingerprint sensors
