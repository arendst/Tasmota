<h2 align = "left">‚≠ê News </h2>

1. In order to be compatible with multiple versions of T-Watch, all examples include a `config.h` file. For the first use, you need to define the **T-Watch** model you use in the `config.h` file
2. In the `config.h` file, you can also see similar definitions, such as **LILYGO_WATCH_LVGL**, **LILYGO_WATCH_HAS_MOTOR**, this type of definition, it will be responsible for opening the defined module function, all definitions Will be available here [View](./docs/defined_en.md)
3. Most of the examples are only used as hardware function demonstrations. This library only completes some initialization work and some demonstrations. For more advanced gameplay, please see [TTGO.h](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library/blob/master/src/TTGO.h), to understand how to initialize, after being familiar with it, you can completely leave this library for more advanced gameplay
- About API, please check the source code

<h2 align = "left">üöÄ Characteristics</h2>

1. The library already contains all the hardware drivers for `T-Watch`
2. Using **TFT_eSPI** as the display driver, you can directly call **TFT_eSPI** through the construction object.
3. Using **lvgl 7.0.0** as the display graphics framework, the driver method has been implemented, you only need to call lvgl api according to your own needs.
4. For the use of lvgl please refer to **[lvgl docs](https://docs.lvgl.io/v7/en/html/)**
