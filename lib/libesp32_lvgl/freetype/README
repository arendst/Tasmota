FreeType 2.13.2
===============

Homepage: https://www.freetype.org

FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It  is  written  in  C,   designed  to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
customizable,  and portable  while capable  of producing  high-quality
output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.

Please   read  the   `docs/CHANGES`   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
INFORMATION.

Read the files `docs/INSTALL*`  for installation instructions; see the
file `docs/LICENSE.TXT` for the available licenses.

For using FreeType's git repository  instead of a distribution bundle,
please read file  `README.git`.  Note that you have  to actually clone
the repository; using a snapshot will  not work (in other words, don't
use gitlab's 'Download' button).

The FreeType 2 API reference is located in directory `docs/reference`;
use the file  `index.html` as the top entry point.   [Please note that
currently  the search  function  for  locally installed  documentation
doesn't work due to cross-site scripting issues.]

Additional documentation is  available as a separate  package from our
sites.  Go to

  https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/

and download one of the following files.

  freetype-doc-2.13.2.tar.xz
  freetype-doc-2.13.2.tar.gz
  ftdoc2132.zip

Mailing Lists
-------------

The preferred  way of  communication with the  FreeType team  is using
e-mail lists.

  general use and discussion:      freetype@nongnu.org
  engine internals, porting, etc.: freetype-devel@nongnu.org
  announcements:                   freetype-announce@nongnu.org
  git repository tracker:          freetype-commit@nongnu.org

  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/issues

Alternatively,    you    might    report    bugs    by    e-mail    to
`freetype-devel@nongnu.org`.    Don't  forget   to  send   a  detailed
explanation of the problem -- there  is nothing worse than receiving a
terse message that only says 'it doesn't work'.
