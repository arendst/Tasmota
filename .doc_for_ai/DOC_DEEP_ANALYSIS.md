- ESP32: Much more generous memory, supports advanced features
- Code size optimization is critical for ESP8266 OTA updates
- Flash memory partitioned for dual-boot OTA capability

### Communication Protocols
1. **MQTT** (Primary): All device control and telemetry
2. **HTTP**: Web interface and REST API
3. **Serial**: Direct console access
4. **WebSocket**: Real-time web interface updates

### Extensibility Mechanisms
1. **Rules**: Event-driven automation (up to 1536 characters)
2. **Berry Scripts**: Full programming language (ESP32 only)
3. **Scripting**: Legacy scripting system (ESP8266)
4. **Templates**: Device configuration sharing
5. **Custom Drivers**: C++ sensor/peripheral drivers
